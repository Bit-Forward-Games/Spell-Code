Patrick notes for thinking

* implement jump out of slide at 1/2 jump strength to allow for super short hop and for chaining movements and make jump out of slide not put you super high in the air
* &nbsp;	decided that 1/2 jump strength may allow for too degenerate movement tech, will have to AB playtest
* to deal with people having trouble with slipping and sliding while trying to use their spellcodes, I am making the friction while spellcoding on the ground larger
*  	similarly, halting from movement will have greater friction
*  	in order to allow for that fun move forward movement while spellcoding, I'm keeping the momentum in the air codeweave state
* since this new technique allows the player to effectively code out of slide, I am expressly allowing the transition from slide to codeweave, as to not "dexterity check" players with a movement tech to do something that is so useful
