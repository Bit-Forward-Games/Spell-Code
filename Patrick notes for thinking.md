Patrick notes for thinking

* implement jump out of slide at 1/2 jump strength to allow for super short hop and for chaining movements and make jump out of slide not put you super high in the air
*  	decided that 1/2 jump strength may allow for too degenerate movement tech, will have to AB playtest
* to deal with people having trouble with slipping and sliding while trying to use their spellcodes, I am making the friction while spellcoding on the ground larger
*  	similarly, halting from movement will have greater friction
*  	in order to allow for that fun move forward movement while spellcoding, I'm keeping the momentum in the air codeweave state
* since this new technique allows the player to effectively code out of slide, I am expressly allowing the transition from slide to codeweave, as to not "dexterity check" players with a movement tech to do something that is so useful\\
* I am purposefully making it so that you can not cancel the codeweave animation with jump (or any other action for that matter), as allowing the cancelation of this state enables skilled players to become invulnerable and/or armored for 90 percent of the game, leading to VERY degenerate play at higher levels of play





Spell reworks and balance

* add double jump to base kit because gating double jump behind a power (or any other fun core movement for that matter) kinda feels bad
*  	instead of boots of Hermes giving you a double jump, make boots of Hermes give you another air jump for every 4 reps
*  		builds into the fantasy of Hermes flight and meshes well with the reps system, also isn't egregious in our game assuming we make the game map such that you can always reach every point in the stage with just a double jump and a basic attack
* skillshot slash I simply added an extra 10 damage if you hit it while in flowstate so its self sufficient)
* ninja\_build\_blast rework to make it self sufficient (at start of move have a skillshot hitbox)
*  	adjust flowstate passive on this spell to instead refund all cooldowns based on how much flowstate is consumed
* re-sprite Gift of promethius to be twice the size for more "oomph" factor and to really sell it as a big cash out move that deserves a 4 input code
*  	to balance this, give it an 8 second cooldown
* Might of zeus will now spawn 3 lightning bolts instead of 1, staggered in timing and position
*  	to balance this, each bolt will only do 5 damage down from 10
* Amon Slash is the fantasy of BIG BLEED, being able to kill a character at full demon aura, though notably a goal with it was to encourage not using a basic attack after every spell, and as such I used the formula of extra damage = (demon aura/10)^2, with each hit of amon slash granting 20 demon aura. this leads to the following damage calculations:
*  	1 slash = 4 effect damage
*  	2 slash = 16 effect damage
*  	3 slash = 36 effect damage
*  	4 slash = 64 effect damage
*  	5 slash = 100 effect damage (a full health target)
* I made it so that demon aura reduces itself based on damage taken to make it there is some way to deal with the more annoying parts of the Demon-X spells





Potential comeback mechanic for RNG:
having the curated RNG to help with runs (making sure u get at least 1 spell in ur brand, no repeats, no passives for brands you dont own, etc.), which goes away as you win, creating more chaotic builds



bounty system explained (current iteration):
 - players are worth 200 ram at a base value, split between players based on damage participation

&nbsp;- a bonus of a flat 50 ram is awarded to the person who gets the kill (total 150 ram for a solo kill)

&nbsp;- each player's bounty is based on how much total ram they have relative to the
